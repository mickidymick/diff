Speedup_C = 1 / [(1 - P) + (P / N)]

In this formula:
- P denotes the portion of the workload amenable to parallelization (40% or 0.4).
- N signifies the count of computing cores (8 cores).

For Processor C, characterized by its 8 cores, each running at 2.0 GHz, the speedup computation unfolds as follows:

Speedup_C = 1 / [(1 - 0.4) + (0.4 / 8)] = 2.22

Now, let's juxtapose the computed speedup values for the three processors:

Processor A (single core at 3.2 GHz): Speedup_A = 1.67
Processor B (quad core with 2.1 GHz cores): Speedup_B = 1.25
Processor C (8 cores at 2.0 GHz each): Speedup_C = 2.22

The comparison of these speedup values reveals that Processor C emerges as the top performer among the three alternatives. This implies that the newly introduced parallel protein folding procedure can effectively leverage the increased core count in Processor C, resulting in notably enhanced performance when juxtaposed with the other two processor options.

Therefore, the prudent choice for the research team would be to select Processor C as the preferred candidate for their laboratory's protein folding procedure. The amalgamation of a higher core count and the parallelization capability inherent in the new algorithm is poised to deliver the most optimal overall performance for their specific workload.
